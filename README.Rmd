# electric_journey_planner

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of electric_journey_planner is to use the UK open charge point registry to develop a method for determining the journey for an electric vehicle over an arbitrary distance. 

Also will use the google maps api to get the distances between any two postcodes and cache them


## Overview plan

Using the publically available charging points database at [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/1ce239a6-d720-4305-ab52-17793fedfac3/national-charge-point-registry) I can extract the postcodes of the current charge points across the whole UK. This is specifically the repository of publically accesible charging points, so doesn't account for any of the privately installed and accesible points. 

These then form the nodes of the network of charging points across the uk.
